        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment had a focus on colour palettes and animations on a web
          page. Since this assignment didn't include who this website was for,
          there was more freedom. The task was to find colours that complemented
          each other, using an accent colour correctly and making sure contrast
          between text and background passed a contrast checker. Lastly adding
          animations to buttons and links to make the website less static.

        <h4>Colour Palette</h4>

        <div class="colour_palette">
          <p>
            I decided to go with a palette consisting of red/brown-ish earth
            colours, a pink accent colour and some neutral greys and white. I
            decided to go with a monochromatic palette since the design I worked
            with was quite simple.

        <div class="colour_testing">
          <h4>Colour Exercise</h4>
          <p>
            Here I experimented with different combinations of the colours as
            backgrounds and as fonts to see which worked and which didn't. It
            makes it quite useful to have done this before implementing it to a
            design since you know beforehand what not to do.

        <div class="colour_contrast">
          <h4>Colour Contrast</h4>
          <p>
            I made use of Adobe's colour contrast checker which is very useful
            for telling you how to make your website more accessible.

        <div class="css_variables">
          <h4>CSS Variables</h4>
          <p>
            CSS variables are a very useful feature in CSS especially if colour
            needs to be changed, there is only one line to edit.
          </p>

        <div class="animations">
          <h4>Animations</h4>
          <p>
            I added two animations to test my skills in CSS and Javascript. The
            first one is a underline animation which makes use of only CSS
            transition. The second one has 3 different things happen at the same
            time which requires Javascript as well as CSS animation keyframes.
            The button changes from being square to being rounded, the
            background gets darker, the font colour becomes pink and an arrow
            continuously moves to the right and back.
